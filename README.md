# Coding Dojos at REWE

Baseline for katas using Kotlin with JUnit 5.

Prerequisites:

* JDK 17+
* IDE support for Kotlin 1.7.20

You can install a Java SDK locally via [SDKMAN!](https://sdkman.io/) by issuing the command [`sdk env`](https://sdkman.io/usage#env) in this project root directory, see [.sdkmanrc](.sdkmanrc).

Check out [the Gradle build file](./build.gradle.kts) for already added dependencies and feel free to adjust them as you wish.

When you work on a branch, you may want to adjust the Gradle root project name in [settings.gradle.kts](./settings.gradle.kts).
